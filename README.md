A QR code for your website is a convenient tool that allows users to quickly access your site by scanning the code with their smartphones. 
It eliminates the need to manually type the URL, providing a seamless way to connect with your online content. 
This can be especially useful for sharing your site on physical materials like business cards, flyers, or product packaging.
